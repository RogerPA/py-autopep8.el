Provides the =py-autopep8= command, which uses the external =autopep8= tool to tidy up the current buffer according to Python's PEP8.

Install =autopep8= and download =py-autopep8.el=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ pip install autopep8
$ wget https://raw.github.com/paetzke/py-autopep8.el/master/py-autopep8.el -O /your/path/py-autopep8.el
#+END_SRC

Add the before-save-hook to your ~/.emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/your/path/")
(require 'py-autopep8)
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'py-autopep8-before-save)
#+END_SRC

You can also install py-autopep8 with MELPA:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x package-install RET
py-autopep8 RET
#+END_SRC

Now every time you save your Python file autopep8 will be executed on the current buffer.
